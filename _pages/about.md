Hi, I am Samyadeep Basu, a 1st year CS PhD student at UMD, College Park (2022 - Present). I work with [Soheil Feizi](https://www.cs.umd.edu/~sfeizi/) in the [Center for Machine Learning](https://ml.umd.edu/). My research focus is to learn from data with limited supervision (few-shot learning) and model interpretability (variants of influence functions). Previously I received my MS from UMD in 2020 and then spent close to two years at Microsoft AI in the [ML rotation program](https://www.microsoftnewengland.com/maidap/). During my stint at Microsoft AI, I worked with the Language Science Team at [Azure AI](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/cognitive-services-research/knowledge-and-language/) and [MSAI](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/artificial-intelligence-research-munich/) where I researched, developed and deployed large-scale language models for various scenarios.

News 
======
 (April 2022): I will be interning at MSR, Cambridge this summer with the Machine Intelligence team to work on Few-shot learning!
 
 (Feb 2022): Started my PhD to work on few-shot learning!
